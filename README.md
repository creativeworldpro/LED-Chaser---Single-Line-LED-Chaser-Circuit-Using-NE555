In this video, we are going to show you making a simple electronics project. It is called LED chaser. You can call this single line led chaser circuit.
We are making this circuit using a timer cheap IC. To decorate your home or office you can use this circuit.


To make this project, we might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below.


Component List :

1. Timer IC – NE 555
2. Resistor – 220 Ω
             33 K Ω
3. Capacitor - 10µf/ 25v
4. LED – 5mm (red and blue)
5. Copper Wire
6. Power Source – DC 12v

Circuit Connection – 

To make this circuit, we need to follow a normal method of this sound IC. 1st we connect 2 and 6 no leg of timer IC-555. Then we connect 4 and 8 no leg of NE-555 timer IC.
Now, we’ll connect 220 Ω resistor with the circuit. We make a series connection between this resistor. Then we connect resistor with 1 and 8 no leg of NE-555 timer IC.

After this connection, we connect capacitor with the circuit. We connect capacitor negative leg with 1no leg and capacitor positive leg with 2no leg of NE-555 timer IC.
Then we connect 33 K Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 3 and 6 no leg of NE-555 timer IC. Our circuit is almost ready.


Now we connect a parallel connection, in this 8 led lights. Now we connect led negative leg with the series connection of resistor. Then we connect led positive leg with 3no leg of NE-555 timer IC.

It is the time to connect power source with the circuit. For power source, we are using DC 12v. We connect led negative cable with 1no leg of timer IC and connect positive cable with 4no leg of timer IC.
